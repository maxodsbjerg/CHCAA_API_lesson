# Course Overview
The purpose of this course is to help students understand what an Application Programming Interface(API) is and how to interact with them. Interactions with APIs is in this course focussed on extracting data from the APIs. The course has three concrete examples of interactions with three different APIs. All the examples are choosen so that they return data that are obvious relevant for student within the humanities. The examples will therefore consist of text from the newspaper collection at The Royal Danish Library, artworks from the National Gallery of Denmark and aerial photos from the collection An Aerial View of Denmark from The Royal Danish Library. The examples thus provides material for text mining, visual analytics and statistical analysis of a museums collection.  
The course also introduce student to bringing the data from the APIs into data analysis software. Since APIs return data in different ways the three examples will show the three more common ways to do it; Comma Seperated Values(CSV), JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) and Extensible Markup Language(XML). 

## Course Prerequisites
This course assumes that students have done the following to courses:

- [Computational Think Code Camp](https://chcaa.au.dk/#/courses/CT_Code_Camps)  
- [Humanities Programming](https://chcaa.au.dk/#/courses/Humanities_Programming)  

## Learning Objectives
- Basic understanding of APIs
- Ability to interact with APIs
- Wrangling of data from APIs into analytical software
